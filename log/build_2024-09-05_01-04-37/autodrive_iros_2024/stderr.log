CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findslam_toolbox.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "slam_toolbox", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "slam_toolbox" with
  any of the following names:

    slam_toolboxConfig.cmake
    slam_toolbox-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "slam_toolbox" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "slam_toolbox_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "slam_toolbox" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
